Enrollment Display Debug - Frontend vs Backend Discrepancy
==========================================================

The investigation revealed that:
1. Student IS enrolled in program courses (backend shows enrollments)
2. But classroom shows 0 courses (frontend display issue)

This suggests the issue is in how the frontend determines course count for classrooms.
The frontend might be looking at direct courseIds only, not including program courses.
