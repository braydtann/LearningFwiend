# Enhanced Analytics Dashboard - LearningFwiend LMS

## Overview
Based on trainer feedback, I've completely redesigned the analytics dashboard to provide comprehensive training metrics with date-based reporting and multi-level aggregation capabilities.

- Course-by-course performance metrics
- Enrollment counts per class
- Class completion rates
- Average progress tracking
- Total time spent per class
- Quiz and test averages per course
- Instructor assignment visibility

#### **C. Instructor Level**
- Instructor performance summary
- Total courses managed per instructor
- Aggregated enrollment numbers
- Overall completion rates across instructor's courses
