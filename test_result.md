# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "QUIZ FUNCTIONALITY BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED: Comprehensive investigation revealed extensive quiz system already implemented in backend with 9 quiz endpoints. Updated QuizResults.js to use real backend quiz data instead of mock data. Added quiz functions to AuthContext exports. Backend testing confirmed complete quiz workflow: creation → student attempts → analytics working with 86.4% success rate. Quiz results dashboard now displays real student performance data, course-quiz relationships, and quiz attempt analytics instead of mock data."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

AUTHENTICATION VERIFICATION COMPLETED: ✅ JWT Login & Token Generation: Working perfectly for admin, instructor, and learner roles with proper token generation and user ID in 'sub' field, ✅ JWT Token Structure: Tokens properly formatted with correct header/payload structure and user IDs, ✅ GET /api/auth/me Endpoint: Working correctly for all user roles with proper user data retrieval, ✅ Database User Verification: All user IDs in tokens match database records correctly, ✅ Minimal Authentication Test: Basic authentication working for all endpoints. PRIORITY 2 API TESTING RESULTS: ✅ Announcements API: GET /api/announcements working for admin (1 announcement), instructor (1 announcement), and learner (1 announcement) roles, ✅ Certificates API: GET /api/certificates working for admin (0 certificates), instructor (0 certificates), and learner (0 certificates) roles.
