# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

## frontend:

##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "QUIZ FUNCTIONALITY BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED: Comprehensive investigation revealed extensive quiz system already implemented in backend with 9 quiz endpoints. Updated QuizResults.js to use real backend quiz data instead of mock data. Added quiz functions to AuthContext exports. Backend testing confirmed complete quiz workflow: creation ‚Üí student attempts ‚Üí analytics working with 86.4% success rate. Quiz results dashboard now displays real student performance data, course-quiz relationships, and quiz attempt analytics instead of mock data."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "üîç CLASSROOM AUTO-ENROLLMENT INVESTIGATION COMPLETED: ‚úÖ Backend auto-enrollment is working perfectly. Comprehensive testing confirms: 1) Students are automatically enrolled in classroom courses when assigned (verified enrollment count increased from 2 to 3), 2) Enrollment records are properly created in database with all required fields (id, userId, courseId, enrolledAt, status, progress), 3) GET /api/enrollments API returns correct data with proper response model validation, 4) Complete workflow tested: create student ‚Üí create course ‚Üí create classroom with assignments ‚Üí verify auto-enrollment ‚Üí verify API access. CONCLUSION: The user's issue ('No courses enrolled yet' on dashboard) is a FRONTEND problem, not backend. The frontend is either: a) Not calling GET /api/enrollments correctly, b) Not processing the enrollment response properly, or c) Has caching/state management issues. Backend functionality is fully operational and working as expected."
