# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

FIXES IMPLEMENTED: 1) Updated AuthContext.js to use process.env.REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL, 2) Fixed CourseDetail.js loading logic to prioritize course loading, 3) Added null safety (course?.title), 4) Updated supervisor config to serve production build with correct backend URL, 5) Created serve-build.sh script for proper static serving.

    message: "🔍 CLASSROOM AUTO-ENROLLMENT INVESTIGATION COMPLETED: ✅ Backend auto-enrollment is working perfectly. Comprehensive testing confirms: 1) Students are automatically enrolled in classroom courses when assigned (verified enrollment count increased from 2 to 3), 2) Enrollment records are properly created in database with all required fields (id, userId, courseId, enrolledAt, status, progress), 3) GET /api/enrollments API returns correct data with proper response model validation, 4) Complete workflow tested: create student → create course → create classroom with assignments → verify auto-enrollment → verify API access. CONCLUSION: The user's issue ('No courses enrolled yet' on dashboard) is a FRONTEND problem, not backend. The frontend is either: a) Not calling GET /api/enrollments correctly, b) Not processing the enrollment response properly, or c) Has caching/state management issues. Backend functionality is fully operational and working as expected."
