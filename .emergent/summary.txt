<analysis>
The AI engineer's trajectory focused on iteratively enhancing the LearningFwiend LMS through three major phases. Initially, the core LMS features were established. Phase 1 concentrated on User and Department Management, including CRUD for departments, advanced user fields (start date, department), classroom batch IDs, and delete warnings. Phase 2 improved Quiz and Analytics functionalities, adding classroom filtering to analytics and quiz results, a question counter for quiz creation, and document attachments for lessons. Phase 3 centered on Program and Access Control, implementing program deadlines, enforcing course progression, moving the final test to the program level, and adding date-based classroom access. The engineer systematically addressed user feedback, resolving React hook errors and state management issues. The most recent activity involves fixing two critical bugs: programs not appearing after creation and the final test still showing in courses, with a final comprehensive test pending.

The primary objective is LearningFwiend, a custom LMS replicating the Learning 360 UI. Key features include:
-   **User Management**: Admin, Instructor, Learner roles with login, profiles, and an Admin-only edit modal for user details and roles. Enhancements include assigning departments and start dates to users, with pop-up warnings for deletions. The system now supports creating and managing departments with descriptions.
-   **Course Management**: Creation/editing of courses, modules, lessons, supporting various content (YouTube, Google Drive, PDFs, Text, Canva). New functionality includes attaching documents to text/article lessons.
-   **Enrollment & Progress Tracking**: Manual/self-enrollment, course completion, and certificates.
-   **Dashboards**: Role-specific displays.
-   **Classroom Management**: Admin-created cohorts with trainer assignments and KPI tracking. New requirements include adding a classroom batch ID and date-based access control to restrict course access after the classroom end date.
-   **Programs**: Admin functionality to combine courses into structured learning paths. Enhancements include setting deadlines for programs and enforcing sequential course completion. The Final Test has been moved from individual courses to be taken at program completion.
-   **Communication**: Announcements and discussion forums.
-   **Branding**: Full rebranding to LearningFwiend.
-   **Visuals**: Custom character icon integration.
-   **Quiz Maker**: Comprehensive quiz creation (Select All, Long Form, Chronological Order), multimedia support, and a dedicated Final Test. New features include setting the number of questions on a quiz and filtering quiz analytics by classroom.

    -   **Changes**: Integrated classroom access checking to restrict content if the classroom's end date has passed, displaying an Access Denied UI. Crucially, all Final Test related logic and UI elements were *removed* from this page to centralize final tests at the program level.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Admin interface for user management.
    -   **Changes**: Added Department and Start Date fields to the user creation and edit modals. These new data points are displayed as columns in the users table, along with department icons. A pop-up confirmation dialog was added for user deletion.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Manages and displays classroom cohorts.
    -   **Changes**: Added a Classroom Batch ID field to the create modal and displayed it on classroom cards. Implemented visual indicators for classroom access status (e.g., Expired with red styling) based on , disabling View Details button for expired classrooms for students.

    -   **Changes**: Added a Program Deadline field with date picker to the create program modal, displaying deadline status with color-coded warnings on program cards. An Urgent Deadlines statistics card was added. Crucially, fixes were implemented to ensure newly created programs are correctly added to the component's state and re-rendered.
-   ****:

<pending_tasks>
The following tasks are currently being addressed or require final verification:
-   **Program Creation Fix**: Verify that newly created programs now correctly appear on the Programs page.
-   **Final Test Movement Fix**: Confirm that the final test is completely removed from individual course detail pages and is exclusively accessible at the program level.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate focus is on resolving two critical bugs identified after the initial comprehensive End-to-End (E2E) testing. Both fixes have been implemented on the frontend, and the system is awaiting a final verification test.

1.  **Bug: Program Creation Not Appearing on Programs Page**:
    *   **Problem**: When a user created a new program, it was successfully added to the mock data and a success toast appeared, but the program itself did not show up in the list on the  page. This indicated an issue with the React state update and re-rendering.
    *   **Fix**: The AI engineer identified that the  state in  was not being correctly updated after a new program was added. The solution involved ensuring that the  function correctly adds the newly created program object to the existing  array, triggering a re-render of the component to display the new entry. Additionally, the state initialization was simplified and  was used to ensure the  is computed dynamically.
    *   **Files Modified**: ,  (to ensure helper functions are correctly used).

2.  **Bug: Final Test Still Listed in Course Detail Page**:
    *   **Problem**: Despite the requirement to move the final test from individual courses to be exclusive to program completion, a Final Assessment Available! button or similar UI was still present on the  page when course progress reached 80%.
    *   **Fix**: The AI engineer explicitly removed all UI elements and conditional logic related to the final test button and assessment availability from . This ensures that the final test is now only triggered and accessible through the program completion flow as intended.
    *   **Files Modified**: .

The current state is that these fixes have been applied, and the next immediate step is to execute a comprehensive test to confirm their resolution and ensure no new regressions were introduced.

<optional_next_step>
Run a final comprehensive E2E test to verify both the program creation fix and the final test movement from courses are working correctly.
