The previous AI engineer successfully migrated LearningFwiend LMS from mock data to a MongoDB Atlas backend, resolving numerous critical bugs and implementing key features. Initial efforts involved integrating comprehensive CRUD APIs across various modules like Categories, Departments, and Classrooms. Major fixes included rectifying JWT authentication and data model inconsistencies (e.g., , , ). The engineer addressed frontend preview functionality issues, React Select UI crashes due to empty values, and database connectivity problems by migrating to MongoDB Atlas. Recent work focused on enhancing admin capabilities (deleting courses/programs), improving course visibility for all instructors, implementing a save as draft feature for courses, and currently, troubleshooting and fixing browser compatibility issues, specifically with Microsoft Edge. The overall trajectory shows a methodical approach to identifying, diagnosing, and resolving complex full-stack issues.

The LearningFwiend LMS aims to replicate the Learning 360 UI, functioning as a comprehensive platform for educational content management. It supports user, course, classroom, and program administration, enrollment, and role-specific dashboards. The platform accommodates diverse content types (YouTube, Google Drive, PDFs, Canva) and includes program-level final tests. Key enhancements implemented so far include bell notifications, program-based certificates, instructor content creation, dynamic course categories, preview overlays, a screen recorder, 1-level nested programs, and robust authentication with temporary passwords and admin resets. Classroom creation now allows program and department selection. The primary objective for the previous engineer was to migrate all course and program data from client-side  and  to a cloud-based MongoDB backend, enabling multi-user access and sharing, along with crucial bug fixes to ensure application stability and functionality.

- : The core FastAPI backend responsible for all API endpoints and database interactions.
    - Changes: Extensively modified to include CRUD APIs for various modules, fix JWT_SECRET_KEY loading from environment variables, adjust Certificate API to accept both  and , and define the  model to include  and  fields for draft/published courses. Also defines  and  fields for classrooms.
- : Environment variables for backend configuration.
    - Changes:  was extended from 24 to 720 (30 days).  and  were updated from local  and  to the MongoDB Atlas cloud connection string and  database name.
- : Script to create a default admin user.
    - Changes: Modified to reflect the new default admin  with password .
- : (Newly created) Temporary script to update the admin user to Brayden T.
    - Summary of importance: Used once to transition the primary admin user from the default to a specific user.
    - Changes: Script added to remove old admin and create  with a specified password.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was actively working on resolving a critical browser compatibility issue. The user reported that courses were not displaying in Microsoft Edge, despite working correctly in Chrome and Firefox.

The AI engineer's analysis determined that the backend was functioning correctly, indicating a frontend-specific problem, likely related to  API usage or caching behavior in Edge.

To address this, the following changes were implemented:
1.  ** Modification**: The  function was updated to include  in the  options. This aims to prevent potential caching issues specific to Edge that might cause stale or no data to be displayed. The  function was also reviewed for consistency.
2.  **Polyfill Check**: A polyfill check was added to  to potentially address broader compatibility issues in Edge's JavaScript runtime.
3.  **Browser Compatibility Utility**: A new utility file, , was created to include a  helper function. This function helps in identifying the Edge browser.
4.  **Integration of Utility**:  was updated to import and utilize the  function, allowing for conditional logic or adjustments based on the detected browser.
5.  **Reinforced Fetch**: The  function in  was further updated to ensure the Edge-compatible  options are consistently applied.

The backend server was restarted after these changes. The current state is that these fixes have been applied, and the next step is to test their effectiveness in Microsoft Edge.
