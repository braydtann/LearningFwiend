The AI engineer's trajectory involved two main phases: resolving critical deployment issues and then addressing multiple functional bugs related to course management, final exams, progress tracking, and grading. Initially, the focus was on fixing hardcoded URLs and environment variable inconsistencies across frontend and backend, along with robustifying backend services for MongoDB Atlas and adding health checks. After successfully preparing for deployment and guiding the user on how to replace their app, the engineer tackled a bootstrap problem to create an initial admin user by implementing a dedicated endpoint. The final, ongoing phase concentrated on user-reported issues: implementing missing backend routes for final exams and a grading system, creating a frontend grading interface, and planning to fix frontend display logic for progress tracking and final test saving.

The application's core purpose is an online Learning Management System (LMS). The initial identified problem was a Program Enrollment Display Mismatch where auto-enrolled students appeared unenrolled on the frontend (still pending).

Prior implementations included:
1.  **Quiz Image Display**: Correctly displaying Google Drive image URLs for questions/options in  and .
2.  **Progressive Quiz Access**: Logic in  to control quiz access based on module completion.
3.  **Runtime Error Fix**: Resolved  hoisting issue in .

The latest requests involved:
4.  **Deployment Error Fixes**: Resolving issues preventing deployment to a Kubernetes environment with MongoDB Atlas, including hardcoded URLs and environment variable configuration.
5.  **Admin User Bootstrap**: Creating an initial admin user post-deployment.
6.  **Final Test Functionality**: Fixing issues where final exams were not saving, not accessible, and their analytics weren't updating.
7.  **Progress Tracking**: Ensuring student course progress accurately reflects completion on the frontend.
8.  **Grading System**: Implementing a mechanism for instructors to view and grade subjective answers.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving a set of critical functional issues reported by the user, specifically concerning the final test functionality, student progress tracking, and the lack of a grading interface for instructors.

The work sequence involved:
1.  **Diagnosing Backend Gaps**: Through , it was confirmed that backend endpoints for final exams and a grading system were entirely missing. The backend, however, correctly calculated student progress, indicating a frontend display issue.
2.  **Implementing Backend Final Exam & Grading Endpoints**: New API routes were added to  to handle final exam submission, retrieval, and instructor-specific views for answers and grading. These endpoints were verified to be active and require authentication.
3.  **Frontend Grading Interface Creation**: A new React page, , was created under . This page was integrated into the application's routing in  and added as a navigation link in , restricted to admin and instructor roles.
4.  **Investigating Frontend Progress Display**: The  component was examined, and while the backend data for student progress was confirmed correct, the frontend display mechanism was still under review to identify why it wasn't reflecting accurately.
5.  **Final Test Saving Issue**: This issue, reported by the user, is still pending a specific frontend implementation fix.

The backend has been updated with the necessary APIs for both final exams and grading, and a basic frontend shell for the grading interface has been set up. The next step is to address the remaining frontend aspects.
