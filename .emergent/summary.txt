The previous AI engineer successfully transformed the LearningFwiend LMS from an MVP to a robust application by systematically addressing a series of user-reported bugs and feature enhancements. Initial efforts focused on migrating data from mock sources to MongoDB Atlas and establishing comprehensive CRUD APIs. Subsequent work fixed critical issues like JWT authentication, implemented essential features such as default course images and full course editing, and resolved complex data display and interaction bugs (e.g., white screen errors, incorrect dropdown data, and student enrollment detection). The engineer meticulously tackled issues like orphaned enrollments, refined UI permissions, fixed backend-frontend data mismatches, and most recently, fully integrated the quiz system with real backend data. Each step involved thorough investigation, targeted code modifications, and rigorous backend testing.

<product_requirements>
The LearningFwiend LMS is an educational content management platform, mimicking the Learning 360 UI, designed for managing users, courses, classrooms, and programs with role-specific dashboards. It supports diverse content types (YouTube, Google Drive, PDFs, Canva) and integrates program-level final tests. Key features include bell notifications, program-based certificates, instructor content creation, dynamic course categories, preview overlays, a screen recorder, 1-level nested programs, and robust authentication with temporary passwords and admin resets. Classroom creation supports program and department selection. The primary goal was to migrate all course and program data from client-side  and  to a MongoDB backend to enable multi-user access. Continuous bug fixing was a high priority, including resolving issues with student course access, Continue Learning functionality, UI permissions, announcement posting, department dropdown accuracy, Google Drive image display, and integrating a fully functional quiz system.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed a significant integration task: making the quiz functionality fully operational and integrated with the backend.

The user initially reported that the quiz and analytics page was still searching through mock data, and course breakdowns in quiz analytics were also showing mock results, despite quiz creation being available.

The AI engineer's investigation revealed that the backend already had comprehensive quiz functionality, including 9 endpoints for CRUD operations on quizzes and attempts, and advanced features like publishing, scoring, time limits, and various question types. The primary issue was the frontend's continued reliance on  for displaying quiz results and analytics.

The following key changes were implemented:
-   **Backend Enhancements**: Minor fixes were made to ensure data compatibility (e.g., missing fields in quiz attempts like , , ), and to ensure quizzes are correctly published. Quiz answer format requirements were also corrected.
-   **Frontend Integration ()**: The  page was completely overhauled. It now uses real backend APIs (, , , ) to fetch data. This involved updating imports, implementing proper async data loading with error handling and loading states. The logic for student performance analytics and course-quiz filtering was updated to aggregate and filter based on actual backend relationships and quiz attempts, replacing all mock data usage.
-   **AuthContext**: Confirmed that necessary quiz-related functions already existed and were properly exported, removing initial attempts to duplicate them.

As a result, the quiz results page now displays real-time data, student performance is calculated from actual quiz attempts, and filtering uses dynamic backend course and classroom data. The system now has a complete, integrated quiz system from creation to analytics.

The previous engineer has completed all requested fixes and integrations, confirming the system is ready. The next step, as indicated by the user, is to fork the project.
