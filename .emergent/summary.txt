The previous AI engineerâ€™s trajectory details a series of bug fixes and feature enhancements, starting with a critical deployment issue. Initially, the system encountered warnings and a service temporarily available error during deployment. A  diagnosed an incorrect  in , which the engineer promptly corrected, restoring deployment functionality. Subsequently, the focus shifted to a new user request: enabling Google Drive image URLs to display correctly within quiz questions and answer options across various question types (True/False, Multiple Choice, Select All, Chronological Order, Short Form, Long Form) in both  and . The engineer implemented a  utility function and integrated it into the image rendering logic for questions and options in these components. The successful implementation was confirmed via backend testing, showing a 100% success rate for the image conversion fix. The initial  remains a pending task.

The application's primary goal is an online learning management system. The initial identified problem was a **program enrollment display mismatch**, where students auto-enrolled via the backend were incorrectly shown as NOT enrolled in the frontend. This specific issue involves frontend display logic, as backend enrollment was confirmed functional.

Subsequently, the user explicitly requested the following features and fixes:
1.  **Quiz Image Display Issue**: Image URLs provided for quiz answer options and question images, particularly from Google Drive, were not displaying correctly across several question types (True/False, Multiple Choice, Select All That Apply, Chronological Order, Short Form, Long Form). The requirement was to ensure these images render properly.
2.  **Progressive Quiz Access Feature**: Implement logic to control the visibility of the start quiz button, allowing students to access a quiz only after completing preceding modules or lessons.
3.  **Runtime Error Fix**: Resolve a  during quiz-taking, identified as a JavaScript hoisting issue.
4.  **Deployment Error Fix**: Address a missing  file that prevented the application from building, requiring its recreation with the correct .

-   **/app/frontend/.env**: Crucial for frontend environment variables.
    -   *Summary of why this file is important*: Stores , essential for frontend-backend communication during deployment and runtime.
    -   *Summary of changes*: Was initially missing, then created with . Subsequently, it was found to contain an incorrect preview URL and was updated to , and later corrected to  (based on build logs and user confirmation).
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/QuizTakingNewFixed.js**: Core component for students to take quizzes, handling question and option rendering.
    -   *Summary of why this file is important*: Central to the quiz experience, displaying questions, options, and managing user interaction.
    -   *Summary of changes*:
        *   Added a  utility function to transform Google Drive sharing links into direct image URLs.
        *   Integrated  into the rendering logic for  (around lines 1197-1210 and 1220-1240) to support Google Drive images across all question types.
        *   Applied  to Multiple Choice option images (around lines 1334-1345).
        *   Applied  to Chronological Order item images in both the available items area (around line 1568) and the answer area (around line 1647).
        *   Previously, the file also had fixes for mixed data formats for image URLs and a hoisting issue for .
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/FinalTest.js**: Manages the final examination experience.
    -   *Summary of why this file is important*: Displays final exam questions and options.
    -   *Summary of changes*:
        *   Added the  utility function, identical to the one in .
        *   Integrated  into the rendering logic for  (around lines 633-646) to support Google Drive images for final test questions.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/CourseDetail.js**: Displays course details and controls quiz access based on student progress.
    -   *Summary of why this file is important*: Essential for course content display and managing progressive quiz availability.
    -   *Summary of changes*: Implemented  to control quiz button visibility, showing accessible quizzes with purple buttons and locked ones with gray disabled buttons.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/CreateCourse.js**: Used by instructors for course and quiz creation.
    -   *Summary of why this file is important*: Defines the data structure for quizzes and questions, influencing how media is stored.
    -   *Summary of changes*: No direct code changes; primarily examined for understanding data structures.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully addressed the user's request to fix Google Drive image URLs not displaying correctly for quiz questions and answer options. This involved:

1.  **Deployment Fix**: The primary recent action was resolving a deployment issue where the  file had an incorrect  (a preview domain). The  identified this, and the AI engineer updated the file to  (from the build logs and user confirmation). The user verified this fix by confirming that the  endpoint was accessible.
2.  **Google Drive URL Conversion**: Following the deployment fix, the AI engineer implemented a  utility function in  and . This function transforms Google Drive sharing URLs (e.g., ) into direct image URLs (e.g., ).
3.  **Integration**: This utility was integrated into the image rendering logic for:
    *   Question images in  and .
    *   Multiple Choice option images in .
    *   Chronological Order item images (both available and answer options) in .
4.  **Verification**: The fix was successfully tested using , confirming that the Google Drive URL conversion logic functions as expected with a 100% success rate. The AI engineer concluded this task as completed.
