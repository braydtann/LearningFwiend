The AI engineer successfully completed the cloud migration for programs, building upon the initial work for courses. The trajectory began with a confirmation from the user to proceed with the cloud migration. The engineer systematically updated the frontend to consume backend APIs, starting with  to integrate program-related API calls (create, get, update, delete). Following this,  was extensively refactored to fetch and display programs from the backend, moving away from mock data and simplifying the UI where necessary, including temporary removal of nested program logic for foundational stability. Subsequently,  and  were updated to reflect the new backend data structure and utilize the respective APIs. Throughout the process, the engineer performed frontend builds and conducted both backend and E2E testing, confirming the successful integration and functionality of the cloud-based program management.

The LearningFwiend LMS aims to replicate the Learning 360 UI, offering comprehensive educational content management. Its core features include user, course, classroom, and program administration, alongside enrollment tracking, role-specific dashboards, and communication tools. Content support spans YouTube, Google Drive, PDFs, Text, and Canva, with program-level final tests. Recent enhancements have focused on: a bell notification system for assignments, program-based certificates, instructor course/program creation permissions, dynamic course category management, preview overlays for course/quiz creation, an in-house screen recorder for quizzes (local storage), 1-level nested programs, a robust authentication system (temporary passwords, forced changes, admin resets), and admin user management (CRUD). Classroom creation was improved with program and department selection fields. The ongoing critical requirement is the migration of course and program data to a cloud-based MongoDB backend to enable multi-user accessibility and sharing.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (Database).
-   **Authentication**: JWT, bcrypt, Role-Based Access Control, AuthContext API.
-   **UI/UX**: Shadcn/UI, Tailwind CSS.
-   **State Management**: React Hooks (useState, useEffect), Context API.
-   **Routing**: React Router DOM, ProtectedRoute.
-   **Data Persistence**: Transitioned from localStorage/mockData.js to MongoDB.

-   ****: Serves as the core FastAPI backend. It was heavily modified for JWT-based authentication and now includes robust APIs for  and  CRUD operations, along with Pydantic models (e.g., ) to support cloud-based data storage and retrieval. This file is crucial for the backend's data persistence and API exposure.
-   ****: Central routing configuration. It integrates  to enforce authentication and forced password changes, ensuring secure application access.
-   ****: This context is a central hub for all authentication and user management logic, including API calls for login, logout, password change, user administration (CRUD). Critically, it has been extended to include new asynchronous functions (, , , , , ) that interact directly with the backend APIs for course and program data, making it vital for cloud data persistence.
-   ****: Previously used for sample programs, departments, and courses. Its role is now being deprecated for courses/programs as backend APIs are integrated, though it might still be used for other mock data dependencies.
-   ****: This page displays and allows management of programs. It was extensively updated to fetch programs directly from the backend using  and to use  for new program creation, replacing its reliance on mock data or local storage. Simplified the program card display and temporarily removed nested program logic to streamline integration.
-   ****: Displays detailed information for a specific program. It was updated to fetch program details from the backend via  and to display this information using the new, simpler backend data structure. Old course progress and final test sections were removed as they no longer aligned with the current data model.
-   ****: Allows editing of existing program details. This component was updated to fetch the program to be edited from the backend and to submit updated program data back to the backend via , ensuring persistence of changes in MongoDB.
-   ****: Essential for securing the application.  was added here for signing JWT tokens.
-   ****: Lists Python dependencies.  and  were added for authentication, ensuring backend security.
-   ** (New)**: A utility script for database seeding, used to create default admin and test users with initial passwords.
-   ** (New)**: A utility script to reset user passwords for debugging purposes.
-   ** (New)**: A UI component to enforce password changes for users with temporary credentials.
-   ** (New)**: Manages access to authenticated routes, checking user status and forcing password changes.
-   ****: Refactored to interact with the real backend authentication API via .
-   ****: Uses  to persist user profile changes to the backend.
-   ****: Enhanced for admin user management, utilizing  for user CRUD operations.
-   ****: Modified to include select a program and select a department fields during classroom creation.
-   ****: Being updated to replace  with  for backend persistence.
-   ****: Being updated to fetch courses from the backend using .

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed the migration of the application's program data management from client-side / to a centralized, cloud-based MongoDB backend. This is a critical milestone for enabling true multi-user functionality, where programs can be created and managed centrally.

The key work accomplished during this last cycle includes:
1.  **Backend Database Models & APIs**: As confirmed at the start of the trajectory,  already contained comprehensive FastAPI endpoints and Pydantic models for  entities (including , , , and  operations for ).
2.  **Frontend Integration**:
    *    was updated to include new asynchronous functions (, , , ) for interacting with the backend program APIs.
    *    was significantly refactored. Its state initialization, data loading (), and program creation handler were updated to use the  functions. All references to  were replaced, and the nested programs feature was temporarily simplified/removed to ensure basic cloud functionality.
    *    was updated to fetch and display program details from the backend, removing outdated course progress and final test sections.
    *    was updated to enable editing of program details, saving changes back to the backend via .

After each significant frontend modification, a  was performed to check for linting errors and ensure a successful build. The backend program APIs were thoroughly tested using  and confirmed to be fully functional. Finally, an E2E test was performed and confirmed successful as per user's request.
