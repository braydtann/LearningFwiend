<analysis>
The AI engineer's work, building upon an initial LMS MVP, followed an iterative, problem-solving trajectory. It began by addressing core functionalities (user, department, quiz, analytics, program management) outlined in a prior analysis phase. The current trajectory focused on two critical bug fixes: program creation visibility and final test placement. Subsequently, the engineer enhanced the Final Test creation to incorporate comprehensive quiz maker elements and resolved a persistent Made with Emergent watermark issue, which proved challenging due to dynamic injection. Finally, a new feature was added: Enrollment Type for courses, followed by an enhancement to Canva presentation lessons to support embed codes for direct display. Throughout, the engineer systematically diagnosed issues, implemented targeted fixes, and verified solutions with screenshots, demonstrating a methodical approach to feature development and bug resolution.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The main HTML entry point for the React application.
    -   **Changes**: Initially, CSS was added to hide a Made with Emergent watermark. Due to persistence, the element itself and then a dynamically injected script related to PostHog were removed/commented out. The final, working solution involved a targeted CSS rule to hide the badge and a gentle JavaScript approach to remove dynamically added watermark elements without breaking the React app.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Defines the core routing for the application.
    -   **Changes**: A new route  was added to enable editing of programs, which previously caused a white screen due to a missing route definition.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Stores all mock data and provides helper functions for frontend operations.
    -   **Changes**: New helper functions , , and  were added to manage program data. Existing  were updated to reflect comprehensive final test structures. All  were updated to include a new  field ( or ).
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Manages creation and display of learning programs.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed a bug where newly created programs didn't appear by updating the  helper function and correctly updating the component's state. Enhanced the Create Program modal to include comprehensive final test configuration (title, time limit, passing score, question types, media support) by integrating  and new handler functions.
-   ** (New File)**:
    -   **Summary**: Provides an interface for editing existing learning programs.
    -   **Changes**: Initial creation as a dedicated page for program editing. Enhanced to include comprehensive final test management, allowing instructors/admins to edit test parameters and questions using the  component and associated handler functions.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Interface for instructors to build course content.
    -   **Changes**: The Final Test Configuration section and all related handler functions and state (e.g., , ) were completely removed to centralize final tests at the program level. A new Course Access Type field was added, allowing selection between Open Enrollment and Assignment Only. The Canva Presentation lesson type was enhanced to include an Embed Code textarea alongside the URL field, with step-by-step instructions.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Displays detailed course content.
    -   **Changes**: Confirmed removal of Final Test related UI and logic from this page. Logic was added to display Canva presentations using an embed code if available, falling back to a URL.
-   ** (New File)**:
    -   **Summary**: A reusable component to handle the comprehensive creation and editing of quiz/test questions.
    -   **Changes**: Created to encapsulate the complex UI and logic for various question types (Multiple Choice, Select All, True/False, Short Answer, Long Form, Chronological Order), including media support and point configuration. This component is now used in both  and  for final test management.

<current_work>
The most recent work focused on enhancing the Canva Presentation lesson type within the course creation interface. The user requested the ability to add an embed code for Canva presentations so they display directly on the course page, rather than requiring students to navigate to an external link.

The AI engineer implemented this by:
1.  **Modifying **: Added a  textarea field below the existing Canva URL field. This new field includes a placeholder with an example embed code and provides step-by-step instructions for instructors on how to obtain the embed code from Canva. The component's state was updated to capture this new  for lessons.
2.  **Modifying **: Updated the logic to prioritize the  for displaying Canva presentations. If an  is present, it will be rendered directly; otherwise, it will fall back to using the .
3.  **Testing and Verification**: The engineer used screenshots to confirm that the new fields and instructions were correctly displayed on the course creation page, and that both the URL and embed code options were working as intended, including dynamic feedback upon embed code detection.

This enhancement significantly improves the student experience by allowing seamless viewing of Canva presentations within the LMS.
