The AI engineer's work in this trajectory primarily focused on resolving critical deployment issues identified from provided build logs, following an initial set of bug fixes and feature implementations by a previous AI. The process involved a systematic diagnosis of hardcoded URLs, environment variable discrepancies, and robustification of backend services for a production Kubernetes environment using MongoDB Atlas. Key actions included updating hardcoded URLs in frontend files (, ) and correcting the  in . Significant enhancements were made to  for MongoDB connection resilience, health checks, and production-grade logging. The work concluded with comprehensive local testing and a detailed summary confirming the application's deployment readiness, explicitly attributing any remaining 503 errors to external infrastructure.

The overarching goal of the application is an online learning management system (LMS). The initial problem identified was a **program enrollment display mismatch**, where students auto-enrolled via the backend appeared NOT enrolled in the frontend. This remains a pending frontend display logic issue.

Prior to the deployment focus, the user had explicitly requested and seen implementation for:
1.  **Quiz Image Display Issue**: Ensuring image URLs, especially Google Drive links, display correctly for questions and answer options across various quiz types in  and . This involved creating and integrating a  utility.
2.  **Progressive Quiz Access Feature**: Implementing logic in  to control start quiz button visibility, allowing access only after completing preceding modules.
3.  **Runtime Error Fix**: Resolving a  in  due to a JavaScript hoisting issue.
4.  **Deployment Error Fix**: Initially, a missing  file was resolved by recreating it with . This specific trajectory then tackled subsequent deployment failures reported by the user through build logs. The primary intent for this phase was to identify and resolve all application code-level issues preventing successful deployment to a production Kubernetes environment using MongoDB Atlas.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving deployment issues identified from user-provided build logs. The work involved a systematic approach to ensure the application could successfully deploy to a Kubernetes environment and connect to a production MongoDB Atlas instance.

The key actions taken include:
1.  **Hardcoded URL Remediation**: Identified and updated hardcoded backend URLs in  (from  to ) and  (replacing  with relative  paths).
2.  **Environment Variable Correction**: Verified and corrected the  in  to , matching the URL used in the production build environment.
3.  **MongoDB Atlas Robustness**: Enhanced the  connection configuration in  to include production-grade settings for MongoDB Atlas, such as connection pooling, timeouts, and retry writes.
4.  **Health Check Implementation**: Added a new  endpoint in  to provide real-time status updates on the application and its database connectivity, crucial for Kubernetes deployments.
5.  **Enhanced Logging and Error Handling**: Integrated more robust and environment-aware logging in , including detailed error messages for database connection failures and startup diagnostics. Duplicate logging configurations were also removed.
6.  **Startup Database Connection Test**: Implemented an  event in  to proactively test the MongoDB connection upon application start-up, providing early error detection.

All these changes were rigorously tested locally, including service restarts, log checks, manual endpoint testing (e.g., , root API), and a comprehensive run of the  agent. The tests confirmed that the backend is fully operational, deployment-ready, and all code-level issues preventing deployment have been resolved. The 503 error encountered by the user was ultimately attributed to external infrastructure/networking, not application code.
