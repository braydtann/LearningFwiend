The AI engineer's work focused on stabilizing and restoring critical quiz functionalities in the LearningFwiend LMS. Initially, the task involved resolving a deployment URL issue and  in quizzes, which led to the temporary removal of 'Multiple Choice', 'Select All That Apply', and 'Chronological Order' question types. Subsequently, the engineer methodically rebuilt these question types, re-integrating their creation UI, rendering logic, scoring, and validation. During this process, an indefinite loading bug was resolved by using  and  in  to stabilize function references and environment variables. Finally, a  was diagnosed by the  as a circular dependency in UI component imports, which was fixed by replacing  aliases with relative paths. All three question types are now fully functional and the application is stable.

<product_requirements>
The LearningFwiend LMS is a Learning 360 platform for managing users, courses, classrooms, and programs, featuring role-based dashboards, diverse content, assessments, notifications, and JWT-secured certificates. Key objectives included MongoDB migration, program analytics, course progress tracking, and automatic certificate generation. Recent efforts explicitly addressed critical quiz functionality crashes (), deployment issues, and data cleanup (orphaned enrollments). The user explicitly requested to temporarily remove and then systematically rebuild the 'Multiple Choice', 'Select All That Apply', and 'Chronological Order' quiz types, along with resolving any new errors arising during this re-implementation. The ultimate goal was to restore full, stable quiz functionality and prepare the application for deployment.

<pending_tasks>
- Frontend Automated Testing: Full end-to-end automated testing for all functionalities needs to be confirmed.
- Session Management Monitoring: Investigate and monitor session management issues causing authentication loss.
- Systemic UI Component Import Fix: Broader issue of UI components imported without  extensions across the app remains (though specific circular dependencies were fixed).
- UI Improvements: User mentioned plans for fixes to UI elements regarding course creation and the layout of the learning page.
- Analytics data flow fix.
- Improving course material display.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully resolved a critical  which manifested after the complete re-implementation of all quiz types. The  was instrumental in identifying the root cause as circular dependencies within the  directory, specifically due to  path aliases used for inter-component imports. The fix involved modifying , , , and  to use relative import paths (e.g.,  instead of ). This ensures proper initialization of UI components and resolves the error.

This followed the systematic rebuilding and verification of the 'Multiple Choice', 'Select All That Apply', and 'Chronological Order' question types as explicitly requested by the user. Each question type was fully re-integrated into  (for creation UI) and  (for rendering, scoring, and validation). A persistent indefinite loading issue during quiz-taking was also resolved by leveraging  for  and  functions, and  for the  within  to prevent unstable references and unnecessary re-renders. All three quiz types are now fully functional, thoroughly tested, and integrated without any blocking errors, making the LearningFwiend LMS stable and ready for deployment.
