The AI engineer's work in this trajectory primarily focused on stabilizing and restoring critical quiz functionalities in the LearningFwiend LMS. The initial phase involved addressing user-reported  which occurred when taking quizzes with Select All That Apply and Chronological Order question types. This was diagnosed as circular dependencies within  components, specifically due to  path aliases and missing  extensions in imports. The engineer systematically identified and fixed these by replacing aliases with relative paths in , , , and .

After resolving the UI component import issues, a new problem emerged: users were intermittently logged out when navigating the application (e.g., trying to access courses). The  was engaged and identified a temporal dead zone error in , where the  function was called before its declaration. This was promptly fixed by reordering the code. Despite this fix, the logout issue persisted upon further testing.

The trajectory concluded with the AI engineer performing a  run. This comprehensive backend test confirmed that authentication, quiz submission, the toast system (post-fix), scoring, and progress tracking were all functional. Minor data structure issues for specific quiz questions were noted but deemed non-critical to the main user-reported issue. The current state is that core quiz and authentication logic is confirmed to be working on the backend, and the engineer is awaiting user confirmation to proceed with frontend testing.

<product_requirements>
The LearningFwiend LMS is a comprehensive platform for managing educational content, users, and programs, targeting Learning 360 capabilities. Key features include role-based dashboards, diverse content types, assessments, notifications, and JWT-secured certificates. Core objectives included migrating to MongoDB, enhancing program analytics, tracking course progress, and automating certificate generation. Recent development explicitly focused on resolving critical quiz functionality crashes (), addressing deployment issues, and cleaning up orphaned enrollments. A primary user request was to temporarily disable and then meticulously rebuild 'Multiple Choice', 'Select All That Apply', and 'Chronological Order' quiz types, ensuring their creation UI, rendering, scoring, and validation were fully functional and stable. This re-implementation also required resolving any new errors that might arise, aiming for a fully stable application ready for deployment.

<pending_tasks>
- Frontend Automated Testing: Full end-to-end automated testing for all functionalities needs to be confirmed.
- Session Management Monitoring: Investigate and monitor session management issues causing authentication loss (persists in frontend after login).
- Systemic UI Component Import Fix: Broader issue of UI components imported without  extensions across the app remains (though specific circular dependencies were fixed).
- UI Improvements: User mentioned plans for fixes to UI elements regarding course creation and the layout of the learning page.
- Analytics data flow fix.
- Improving course material display.
- Minor data structure issues in specific quiz questions (missing  and  fields) identified by backend testing.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully resolved a critical  which was reported by the user when attempting quizzes with Select All That Apply and Chronological Order types. The  was instrumental in identifying the root cause as circular dependencies within the  directory. The fix involved modifying , , , and  to use relative import paths (e.g.,  instead of ). This ensured proper initialization of UI components and initially resolved the error.

Following this, a session management issue arose where the user was logged out upon navigating the application. The  diagnosed this as a temporal dead zone error in , where the  function was called before its declaration. This was addressed by reordering the function declaration. However, subsequent frontend testing attempts still resulted in logout issues after navigating to the courses page.

To verify core functionality, a  run was performed. This confirmed that authentication (admin/student logins), quiz submission, the toast system (post-fix), quiz scoring, and progress tracking are all functional at the backend level. The backend tests also identified minor data structure issues in specific quiz questions (missing  and  fields), but these do not block the core functionality. The current state is that the backend is confirmed to be stable for quiz and authentication logic, and the engineer is awaiting user instruction to proceed with frontend testing, especially given the persistent frontend session issues.
