Auto-Enrollment Investigation - Program to Classroom Course Assignment
=====================================================================

Investigating why classrooms show 0 courses when they should show courses from assigned programs.
This is the root cause of the enrollment display bug mentioned in the review request.

Findings from previous test:
- Classroom 'testing exam' has program 'test program 2' with 2 courses but shows 0 courses
- Classroom 'new test' has program 'test program' with 1 course but shows 0 courses

This suggests the auto-enrollment logic is not working properly.
